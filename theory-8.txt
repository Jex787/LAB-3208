## **Lab 8: Speech-to-Text Conversion Using Google Speech Recognition API**

### **Objective**

* To convert spoken words into text using Python.
* To understand the working of Google Speech Recognition API.
* To implement real-time speech input and display corresponding text.

---

### **Theory**

Speech recognition converts spoken language into text using computational models. Google’s Speech Recognition API leverages cloud-based deep learning to provide accurate transcription of speech. The process involves capturing audio via a microphone, sending it to the API, and receiving transcribed text. The `speech_recognition` Python library is commonly used for interfacing with the API in real-time applications.
