Yes, you’re absolutely right.

**Lab 3** typically includes multiple **thresholding techniques**, not just Otsu’s method. Here’s a quick overview of what’s usually covered in such a lab:

---

### **Common Thresholding Techniques in Lab 3**

1. **Global Thresholding**

   * A fixed threshold value (e.g., 128) is applied across the entire image.
   * Simple but sensitive to lighting variations.

2. **Adaptive Thresholding**

   * The threshold is computed locally for different regions of the image.
   * Good for non-uniform lighting conditions.
   * Common methods:

     * Mean Adaptive Thresholding
     * Gaussian Adaptive Thresholding

3. **Otsu’s Thresholding**

   * An automatic, global method.
   * Calculates the threshold by maximizing inter-class variance.
   * Ideal for bimodal histograms (foreground/background contrast).

Would you like me to revise the theory section to include all three methods and label the experiment accordingly?


To perform image segmentation using intensity-based thresholding.

To apply Otsu’s method for automatic threshold selection.

To extract objects or regions of interest from a grayscale image.
